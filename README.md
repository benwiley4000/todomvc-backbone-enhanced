UD989 todo app repo. -- implemented prioritization feature, edit button, and 'done!' label

This work builds off of a Backbone.js implementation of the TodoMVC project (http://todomvc.com/).

I've made edits across the codebase to add a 'done!' label to finished todos, an edit button (as an alternative to double-clicking), and a prioritization feature to signify more important todos. This prioritization can be invoked while the todo is being initially written, or after it has been entered into storage. I've also implemented the ability for the user to filter by priority, in addition to other existing filters.

The starter CSS for the newly implemented features was authored by Ben Jaffe, whose repo this is a fork of. If you're interested in learning to quickly, and cleanly, make changes like these to a JavaScript codebase you've never seen before, written in a framework you're unfamiliar with--among other things!--definitely check out his course on Udacity, JavaScript Design Patterns.
